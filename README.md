# Python Control Flow
# Python Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

# Loops and Control Statements (continue, break and pass) in Python
A break statement, when used inside the loop, will terminate the loop and exit. If used inside nested loops, it will break out from the current loop. A continue statement, when used inside a loop, will stop the current execution, and the control will go back to the start of the loop.

# Looping technique in python
Looping or iteration is fundamental to all programming languages and involves the repetition of tasks. In Python, we use the “for” loop and the “while” loop. We can create various loop types like the infinite while loop in Python with control statements like break and continue.

# range vs xrange on python
The xrange function in Python 2 is a built-in function used to generate a sequence of numbers within a specified range. The range function, which creates a list containing the entire sequence and stores it in memory, xrange creates an object that generates the numbers on the fly.

# Programs for printing pyramid technique in python
n the first loop, we iterate from i = 0 to i = rows . The second loop runs from j = 0 to i + 1. In each iteration of this loop, we print i + 1 number of * without a new line. Here, the row number gives the number of * required to be printed on that row.

# Chaining comparison in python
In Python, chaining comparison operators involves using multiple comparison operators in a single expression to create a more complex logical expression.

# else with for
The else body is executed only if no break is encountered during the execution of the associated loop body

# switch function
The switch is a control mechanism that tests the value stored in a variable and executes the corresponding case statements

# Using iteration in python effectively
Iterate through diverse iterable types using a for loop. This enables you to navigate sequences and perform operations on individual items within lists, sets, and dictionaries.

# Python Itertools
Itertools is a module in python, it is used to iterate over data structures that can be stepped over using a for-loop.

# Python iter() and next() | Converting an object into an iterator
To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods iter() and next() to your object.All classes have a function called init() , which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.

# Python | Difference between iterable and iterator
Iterators power and control the iteration process, while iterables typically hold data that you want to iterate over one value at a time.

# Generators in python
A Python generator function allows to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, providing a faster and easier way to create iterators.

# Generators expression in python
Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions, but they are more memory efficient because they do not create a new list object in memory.
